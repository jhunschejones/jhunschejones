# Hi there! 🙇🏼‍♂️

My name is Josh Jones and I'm a software engineer based out of Chicago, IL USA. When I'm not writing Ruby at work (❤️), I love [mixing rock songs](https://www.musiclikeyoumeanit.com/) and working on [tools for Japanese language learning](https://github.com/stars/jhunschejones/lists/japanese-language-learning). My partner and I live with two, quite vocal cats 🐈‍⬛ 🐈 and we try to tackle as many urban hikes through the Chicago area neighborhoods as we can. We are also on a continuous quest for the best Thai food we can find, and all recomendations are welcome. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you are interested in working on a project together or if you just want to say hi! 👋🏻
